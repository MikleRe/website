    <h2>Together in Aventicum VR</h2>
    <p>
        "Together in Aventicum VR" project aims to enhance the existing Unity VR package from the Computer 
        Perception & Virtual Reality (CPVR) Lab at the Berner Fachhochschule (BFH) by incorporating networking 
        capabilities. 
        This upgrade allows multiple users to interact in a shared virtual space using standalone Android 
        VR headsets that comply with OpenXR standards. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The project includes features like grouped teleportation, full-body avatars, and scene management. 
        Despite initial concerns about performance impacts from inverse kinematics (IK) and hosting, 
        tests showed that a well-optimized self-developped IK solution is feasible and the host experiences 
        less computational strain than clients. 
        The resulting solution is modular, lightweight, and ready for integration with the existing CPVR package.

    <h2>OpenXR VRTogether</h2>
    <p>
        <b>OpenXR VRTogether</b> aims to facilitate virtual reality experiences for multiple players in the 
        same physical space. It transports them to a shared virtual environment where their positions and 
        rotations are synchronized, allowing for physical interaction without the need for external trackers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since headset manufacturers do not offer a reliable calibration option between headsets, this project 
        initially utilizes two physical markers for calibration. These markers establish a shared coordinate 
        axis for each headset. The project is developed using Unity, Quest headsets, and OpenXR.

    <h2>Moodle Moduler</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Moodle Moduler</b> was developed to streamline the process for teachers who need to create modules 
        for their upcoming courses on Moodle.
    </p>
    <p>
        Previously, teachers had to email Moodle administrators with course descriptions and links to previous 
        courses if they wanted to duplicate content. Upon receiving these requests, administrators had to 
        manually process them.
        However, this cumbersome process has been simplified by utilizing a CSV file generated by the course 
        management software used at BFH. This allows for automatic and asynchronous generation of modules 
        using various Moodle APIs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, the BFH Moodle team is evaluating this project for integration into their workflow.

    <h2>Spotify2Zip Websocket</h2>
    <p>
        A website where people could log into using their Spotify account to access their playlists and liked musics.
        With the UI they could choose which media they would like to download as a .zip file.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using a Python Websocket hosted on my Raspberry, I've created a multi threaded server that was able to, based on a 
        Spotify playlist, download Youtube video as mp3 and compress it for the user to download.
    </p>
    <p>
        The biggest usecase of that project was to help my brother out with his old car radio which did not had
        Bluetooth.
        The project was only used for a small amount of time for personnal use because of law issues since it worked with free
        Spotify accounts as well.

    <h2>Excel to Access</h2>
    <p>
        Based on Excel datasheet, I had to create a VBA process with UI to insert the different data input the database.
        On top of that, multiple Access fields had to be inserted for output readibility.

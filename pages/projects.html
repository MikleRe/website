    <h2>OpenXR VRTogether</h2>
    <p>
        <b>OpenXR VRTogether</b> aims to facilitate virtual reality experiences for multiple players in the 
        same physical space. It transports them to a shared virtual environment where their positions and 
        rotations are synchronized, allowing for physical interaction without the need for external trackers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since headset manufacturers do not offer a reliable calibration option between headsets, this project 
        initially utilizes two physical markers for calibration. These markers establish a shared coordinate 
        axis for each headset. The project is developed using Unity, Quest headsets, and OpenXR.

    <h2>Moodle Moduler</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Moodle Moduler</b> was developed to streamline the process for teachers who need to create modules 
        for their upcoming courses on Moodle.
    </p>
    <p>
        Previously, teachers had to email Moodle administrators with course descriptions and links to previous 
        courses if they wanted to duplicate content. Upon receiving these requests, administrators had to 
        manually process them.
        However, this cumbersome process has been simplified by utilizing a CSV file generated by the course 
        management software used at BFH. This allows for automatic and asynchronous generation of modules 
        using various Moodle APIs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, the BFH Moodle team is evaluating this project for integration into their workflow.

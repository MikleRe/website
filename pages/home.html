                I am Dan Simonin, a knowledge starving individual born in 2000. 
                Addicted to computers since I've been able to hold a mouse, 
                I've done video editing, photo tweaking and developing for most of my time.
                Since the start of my IT Studies in 2016, I didn't stop learning new Computer Science
                fields such as: .NET / WPF / Unity, Computer Graphics, Web, Networking, Security, 
                Virtual Reality, Deep learning, Embedded ... 
                <br>
                As a hobby, I mostly go outdoor climbing some rocks or learn about new topics in or out of Computer Science.
